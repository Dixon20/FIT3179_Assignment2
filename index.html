          <h2>History of HIV</h2>
          <p> Many believe that HIV/AIDS originated from <span class = 'Africa_text'>Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of 
            Congo</span> around <b>1920</b>. 
            HIV can be traced back to <b>Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV)</b>, 
             which is an virus that attack the immune system of monkeys 
            and apes. Just like COVID-19, the disease that would have 
            slight reaction towards the animal it contracted to might 
            have significantly worse impact in human. Around that time in 
            <span class = 'Africa_text'>Congo</span>, people hunted meat as their primary source of foods,
            and it is believed that SIV jumped to humans when they 
            ate infected chimps, or there were some of the chimp's 
            blood that entered into the cuts or wounds of the 
            hunters. <b>In 1960s</b>, HIV started to spread to <span class = 'Americas_text'>Caribbean</span> and <span class = 'Africa_text'>Haiti</span>
            when <span class = 'Africa_text'>Haitian</span> professionals brought it to their country upon returning
            from <span class = 'Africa_text'>Congo</span>. The spread was even worsen from rampant sex trade happening at the time,
            and also from <span class = 'Africa_text'>Kinshasa's</span> people migrating across <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>. <b>In 1970s</b> the virus then moved from <span class = 'Americas_text'>Caribbean</span> to <span class = 'Americas_text'>New York City</span>, 
            and then to <span class = 'Americas_text'>San Francisco</span> later in the decade. Then, international travellers
            to <span class = 'Americas_text'>US</span> at the time helped to spread virus even wider across the rest of the globe.

            <br><br>
            <b>In 1980s</b> there was huge AIDS epidemic in <span class = 'Americas_text'>US</span>. <b>In 1981</b>, there were multiple people
            infected with rare type of Pneumonia. Those group consists of 5 gay men and 1 drug injector.
            By the end of the year, there were <b>270 gay men</b> reported with severe immune deficiency and
            <b>121 of them had died</b>. This disease was then called as "gay cancer" or "gay plague".
            Overtime, the disease started to infect heterosexual, children, and 5,000 hemophiliacs at the time,
            that get infected because they require constant donor of blood. <b>In 1984</b>, researchers finally identified the cause of the disease--the HIV virus--and first commerical blood test for HIV was <b>made available in 1985</b>. <b>In 1988, ART is developed</b> and HIV/AIDS epidemic started to become better because the death rate started to <b>decrease</b> with the help of ART. This epidemic was the one that brought HIV <b>across the globe</b>. 

            <br><br>
            <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>, being the continent where it is originated has the <b>highest</b> HIV/AIDS cases
            among all continents across all time. When it all started, HIV spread really fast due to lack of education, gender equality, and health care
            in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>. Until now it is still an important issue in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>, 
            but it's not as worse as it was in the past. Overtime, number of new case and death has been reducing in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>,
            and also countries around the world due to technological advances. All of this can be observed from the map above.

          <h2>How does HIV works?</h2>
          <p>
              HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is virus that attacks specific immune system cell 
              called <b>CD4 helper cell or T cell</b>. Not only it destroys CD4 cells, HIV will also uses 
              the cells to make new replica of itself. The decrease in the number of CD4 cell will
              weaken the body to fight other infections. If left untreated and <b>CD4 counts drop below
              200</b>, <b>HIV will turn into AIDS</b>. So for those that wondered why HIV/AIDS is used interchangeably,
              it's because AIDS is the stage where HIV has become <b>fatal</b>. 

              <br><br>
              HIV can be passed when a person with HIV gets their <b>blood, semen, vaginal fluid,
              or breast milk</b> inside another person's body. Person's urine, sweat, tears, saliva, or 
              vomit does not posses any risk of HIV unless there is blood in it. There are three stages of HIV.
              First, the <b>initial infection</b> where the victim experience flu-like symptoms. Second, is the
              <b>asmpytomatic state(no symptoms)</b> that can last for several years, and that is why people HIV
              might not even know they have it, so it's important to get tested. Finally, the <b>AIDS stage</b> where
              victim will experience multiple symptoms such as Pneumonia,
              rapid weight loss, intense fever, intense diarrhea, blotches on skin, memory loss, extreme
              tiredness, and usually in this stage people can survive for about <b>3 years</b>.

        <h2>How to prevent HIV?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Get tested for HIV regularly if you have active sexual life.</li>
          <li>Always, always, and always use condoms every time you have sex!</li>
          <li>Do not inject drugs, and if you do never share needle with others.</li>
          <li>Choose less risky sexual behaviours such as oral sex. Vaginal and anal sex are the riskiest among all.</li>
          <li>Limit the number of your sexual partners.</li>
          <li>If you have active sexual life, consider consulting about pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). 
            This is a medicine that need to be consumed everyday and it can reduce risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%,
            and from injection of drug by at least 74%.
          </li>
          <li>If you realized that you have done highly risky behaviour. 
            Call your nearest health center, to get post-exposure prophylaxis(PEP).
            This should be quick because if it is not started within 72 hours
            of exposure to HIV it's likely that it won't be effective.
           </li>
           <li>Condoms are best used with water-based or silicon-based lubricants to prevent condom break. 
             This is because they do not eat away at the rubber or latex as oil-based lubricants will.</li>

        <span class = 'Africa_text'>Rwanda</span> is regarded as <span class = 'Asia_text'>'Singapore'</span> of <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span> due to its <b>strong economic growth</b>. <span class = 'Africa_text'>Rwanda</span> also ranked in top 5 for countries in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span> with the <b>best gender equality</b>.

            <h2>Miracle drug for HIV</h2>
              <p>ART is a mixture of antiviral drugs that are used to <b>treat</b> people with HIV, 
                and it was <b>first introduced in 1980s</b>. Few decades ago, surviving <b>more than 10 years</b> with HIV was considered a <b>miracle</b>. 
                Now, thanks to ART, HIV is <b>no longer a death sentence</b> and people with HIV can live to old age like people without HIV. 
                <br><br>ART works by <b>surpressing</b> amount of HIV virus in the body (Viral load) until it is <b>Undetectable</b>. Individuals with <b>Undetectable</b> viral load can not infect other people through <b>sex</b>, and also towards their <b>unborn child if they are a pregnant mother</b>. That is why beside HIV treatment, it is also <b>effective tool in reducing mother-child-transmission rate</b>. Good news is that most of the area in the world already has adequate ART coverage except <b>Eastern Mediterranean area</b>.
              <br><br>
              In <b>Eastern Mediterranean area</b>, ART coverage is still <b>low</b>.
              People with HIV in that area are heavily <b>stigmatized and discriminated</b> against.
              Also, in the past decade there have not been initiative to destigmatize
              HIV. The majority of people in this region also <b>do not have access</b> to HIV testing,
              and therefore does not know their status. In addion to this, the HIV response
              is <b>largely dependent on external donor funding</b> due to low priority given to
              HIV in this area.

            <h2>Which age groups are most at risk from HIV/AIDS?</h2>
            <p>
              Initially the <b>most vulnerable group</b> was <b>under 5 year old</b>. However,
              as the time goes it becomes <b>15 to 49 years olds</b> especially <b>younger
              adults</b>. HIV is primarily transmitted through sex, where <b>unsafe sex</b>
              is a <b>primary risk factor</b>. Individuals around that age might start to experience
              with sex, but lack of adequate education regarding 
              sexually-transmitted disease. Another reason might be that around that age,
              young adult start to try substances and <b>sharing needle</b> without knowing the danger of it.
              That is why HIV education is really <b>important</b> for young adults in preventing new case.
              
              <br><br>
              Another important age group is <b>Under 5</b>.
              This age group is prone to HIV because it is possible for mother
              to <b>infect</b> their <b>unborn child</b> when they are in the womb or as they
              pass through the birth canal, or through breast feeding. However, a child born
              to HIV positive mother without any treatment is <b>not always infected with HIV</b>,
              because only about <b>25%</b> of babies born to HIV-positive mother without treatment are also <b>infected</b>.

          <h2>Is HIV/AIDS more common in men or women?</h2>
          <p>
            The plot shows that HIV prevalence is <b>higher</b> among <span class = 'Male_text'>male</span> in other continents,
            but not in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span> and <span class = 'Oceania_text'>Oceania</span>. If we look closely at <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>, there is significantly more
            <span class = 'Female_text'>female</span> living with HIV than <span class = 'Male_text'>male</span>, and the difference is not little, but <b>very high</b>.
            This is surprising to see because even though in most continent the number is higher for <span class = 'Male_text'>male</span>,
            the difference is not as <b>stark</b> as <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>.
            <br><br>

            In <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span>, there are <b>gender equality</b> and <b>social norm issue</b> that might attribute to
            higher number of HIV cases among <span class = 'Female_text'>female</span>. In there <span class = 'Female_text'>female</span> have <b>limited</b> role in sexual decision-making,
            and protection. In addition to that, there are 52 million of <span class = 'Female_text'>girls</span> that have not <b>finished</b>
            their high school education. Also, due to <b>poverty</b> there are many <span class = 'Female_text'>girls</span> that <b>prostitute</b> themselves.
            Combining all that factors together make <span class = 'Female_text'>female</span> in <span class = 'Africa_text'>Africa</span> highly <b>susceptible</b> to HIV/AIDS.

          Those laws mentioned in the graph can <b>hinder the prevention of HIV</b>. Requiring adolescent
          to have parent consent before be able to test for HIV would actually <b>prevent</b> them
          from doing the testing. This is because in some nations HIV has really <b>big stigma</b> around it 
          and that would make the adolescent reluctant to talk with their parent
          regarding this issue and even worse asking their consent to do the testing. If adolescent wait until legal age, and left untreated,
          the HIV virus in the body will soon turn into AIDS.

          Even though there are only few, there are still <b>multiple nations</b> that require married women to have

          because if the husband does not give his consent, the HIV-positive women can infect her husband, infant child (breast feeding),
          or her unborn child, and this cycle will soon continue.

          <br><br>
          Finally, law that criminalise tranmission of, non-disclosure of or exposure to HIV transmission would makes
          people <b>reluctant</b> to do the testing. This is because if the test result appear to be HIV-positive, the individuals

        <h2>2018-2020</h2>
        <p>
          It can be seen that East and Southern Africa put the highest expenditure in the period between 2018 and 2020. In that area,
          located Sub-saharan Africa where it is the place with the <b>worst HIV/AIDS epidemic in the world</b>. Oppositely, Middle East had the lowest
          expenditure in 2018-2020. As mentioned before, HIV/AIDS is heavily stigmatized and there is low focus on this issue leaving its people
          with inadequate ART coverage and HIV testing. In second place there is Asia and Pacific, in this area HIV is not as worst as Africa area, 
          but it still surpasses some Africa area in term of HIV funding.

        <h2>Upcoming future forecast</h2>
        <p>
          It is predicted that in term of spending, Asia and Pacific area will surpass East and Southern Africa in 5 years. 
          In 2020, there were <b>20.6 million people</b>
          living with HIV in East and Southern Africa, while in Asia and Pacific there were only <b>2.2 million people</b> . 
          The difference is really high, so the only thing that could explain this forecast is that there might change in awareness and policy
          in the Asia and Pacific area that put more emphasize on helping with people living with HIV/AIDS. Also, it can be seen that all areas
          are predicted to have same pattern in which it will increase for little bit before dropping and remain stagnant for the rest of the year.
          This implies that in upcoming few years, HIV will still be an important issue where much funding is still required. However, after some
          time the issue will become significantly better that the amount of spending can be reduced.
